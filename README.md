# Wordpress Primary Category Plugin
This Wordpress plugin will allow the admin to choose a primary category to associate with a post.

For the front end, to search for these custom meta tags, it would be great to use some popular plugins such as:

Search Everything:
https://en-ca.wordpress.org/plugins/search-everything/

Relevanssi:
https://en-ca.wordpress.org/plugins/relevanssi/

Installation Instructions:

1. In the terminal, go to your Wordpress plugin folder (/wp-content/plugins).
2. Use git to clone the project: git clone https://github.com/magas0/primary-category-10up.git
3. This will place the plugin directly into your plugins directory. 
4. Activate the plugin from your Wordpress admin panel.
