# Wordpress Primary Category Plugin
This Wordpress plugin will allow the admin to choose a primary category to associate with a post.

For the front end, to search for these custom meta tags, it would be great to use some popular plugins such as:

Search Everything:
https://en-ca.wordpress.org/plugins/search-everything/

Relevanssi:
https://en-ca.wordpress.org/plugins/relevanssi/

Installation Instructions:

1. Unzip your plugin zip file, make sure the folder is called "post-primary-category" (remove '-master')
2. Copy or move the folder to your plugin directory (/wp-content/plugins/).
